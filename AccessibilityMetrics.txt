# Accessibility Metrics

Should this be local or global?? Both?




potential accessibility
--pop = core-periphery
--urban pop
--settlement popdens
--catchment popdens = 
--sett heir level = SettHierAccess (urban services, sociopolitical institutions) = sum(SettHeirLevel^2/CD)



Destination accessibility or centrality or competition 
--distance weighted local access to urban services
--dist weighted local access to economic opportunity AND/OR competition
--regional socioeconomic inertia
--core-periphery location

the potential accessibility of settlement $j$ to all $n$ destination settlements $i$
$$
A_{j}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{W_{i}}{D_{ji}} \right)
$$
where $W_{i}$ is the weight of a given destination, and $D_{ji}$ is the distance between settlement $j$ and destination $i$.

this is core-periphery

--Among all settlements, with population as the weight, access to economic opportunity/demand/supply 

--Among all settlements, with UrbanPop/Urbanization as the weight, access to urban/sociopolitical services + institutions
